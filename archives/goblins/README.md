# Goblins

  More old archives of rogomatic, rogue (including other versions than 544), debugging scripts, test cases, and a lot of other things.  Some comes from the rogue restoration project, so they might have better and more recent versions.

  Then there might be code that I have no idea if it works, how it works, what I've broken, etc (which is why this part of the archive is called goblins.  :)  )...  You've been warned!

  Ok, well I tried...  I found out the hard way what the limits are to uploads to github so I need to pare things down before I can get them uploaded.  If things go as planned I hope I can get all of the rest of it done before next week is over.

  My most recent working version of possible changes to the debugging scripts (unreleased as of yet) will at least fit.
