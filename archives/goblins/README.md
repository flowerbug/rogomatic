# Goblins

  More old archives of rogomatic, rogue (including other versions than 544), debugging scripts, test cases, and a lot of other things.  Some comes from the rogue restoration project, so they might have better and more recent versions.

  Then there might be code that I have no idea if it works, how it works, what I've broken, etc (which is why this part of the archive is called goblins.  :)  )...  You've been warned!

  Ok, well I tried...  I found out the hard way what the limits are to uploads to github so I need to pare things down before I can get them uploaded.  If things go as planned I hope I can get that done before next week is over.

  My most recent working version of possible changes to the debugging scripts (unreleased as of yet) will at least fit.
