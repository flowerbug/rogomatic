# Archives and Licenses

  These are copies from my local machine.  They may not be all mutually compatible.  Randomly merging them together may result in undefined behaviors.

  Any files that are not written by me may be licensed by someone else and under different licenses.  I hope they are mutually compatible enough to not be a problem but I cannot guarantee that.  In case of any conflict treat the license in a directory as the one in force for that directory and any further subdirectories.

  Any files I have written but not specifically licensed under another license are to be considered Licensed under the LICENSE file included in this directory:


                                 Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004

  If you think something in these archives is not public domain please let me know.
